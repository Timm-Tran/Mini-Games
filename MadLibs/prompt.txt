I can't believe it's already _holiday_! I can't wait to put on my _noun_ and visit every _place_ in
my neighborhood. This year, I am going to dress up as _person_ with _adjective_ _body part_. Before
I _verb_, I make sure to grab my _adjective_ _noun_ to hold all of my _food_. Finally, all of my 
_plural noun_ are ready to go! When _famous person_ asnwers the door, I say, "_noun_ or treat!" 
Yum! I got a _food_ and a _food_. We visit _number_ houses and decide it's time to _verb_ home.
